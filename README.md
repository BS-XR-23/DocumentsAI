# documentsAI
This is a completely private GPT. This always gives answer based on your provided documents. This will not make your private documents public. This does not require an API key or an internet connection.

Built with [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT).

# Environment Setup
In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the LLM model and place it in a directory of your choice:
- LLM: 
 For GPT4All:
 [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin). If you prefer a different GPT4All-J compatible model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.

 For LLMAMA:
[ggml-vic7b-q4_0.bin](https://huggingface.co/vicuna/ggml-vicuna-7b-1.1/resolve/main/ggml-vic7b-q4_0.bin). If you prefer a different LLAMACPP compatible model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.

Keep model inside models folder and documents inside documents folder

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and edit the variables appropriately.
```
MODEL_TYPE: supports LlamaCpp or GPT4All (You can download model from huggingface)
PERSIST_DIRECTORY: is the folder you want your vectorstore in
MODEL_PATH: Path to your GPT4All or LlamaCpp supported LLM
MODEL_N_CTX: Maximum token limit for the LLM model
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME: SentenceTransformers embeddings model name (see https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html)
TARGET_SOURCE_CHUNKS: The amount of chunks (sources) that will be used to answer a question
```

Note: because of the way `langchain` loads the `SentenceTransformers` embeddings, the first time you run the script it will require internet connection to download the embeddings model itself.

## Test dataset
This repo uses a [state of the union transcript](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT/blob/main/source_documents/state_of_the_union.txt) as an example.

## Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Put any and all your files into the `documents` directory

The supported extensions are:

   - `.csv`: CSV,
   - `.docx`: Word Document,
   - `.doc`: Word Document,
   - `.enex`: EverNote,
   - `.eml`: Email,
   - `.epub`: EPub,
   - `.html`: HTML File,
   - `.md`: Markdown,
   - `.msg`: Outlook Message,
   - `.odt`: Open Document Text,
   - `.pdf`: Portable Document Format (PDF),
   - `.pptx` : PowerPoint Document,
   - `.ppt` : PowerPoint Document,
   - `.txt`: Text file (UTF-8),

Run the following command to ingest all the data.

```shell
python ingest.py
```

It will create a `db` folder containing the local vectorstore. Will take 20-30 seconds per document, depending on the size of the document.
You can ingest as many documents as you want, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database.
If you want to start from an empty database, delete the `db` folder.

Note: during the ingest process no data leaves your local environment. You could ingest without an internet connection, except for the first time you run the ingest script, when the embeddings model is downloaded.

## Ask questions to your documents, locally!
In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python documentsAI.py
```

And wait for the script to require your input.

```plaintext
> Enter a query:
```

Hit enter. You'll need to wait 20-30 seconds (depending on your machine) while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again.

Note: you could turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.

Type `exit` to finish the script.


### CLI
The script also supports optional command-line arguments to modify its behavior. You can see a full list of these arguments by running the command ```python documentsAI.py --help``` in your terminal.


# How does it work?
Selecting the right local models and the power of `LangChain` you can run the entire pipeline locally, without any data leaving your environment, and with reasonable performance.

- `ingest.py` uses `LangChain` tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (`SentenceTransformers`). It then stores the result in a local vector database using `Chroma` vector store.
- `documentsAI.py` uses a local LLM based on `GPT4All-J` or `LlamaCpp` to understand questions and create answers. The context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs.
- `GPT4All-J` wrapper was introduced in LangChain 0.0.162.


## Python Version
To use this software, you must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python will not compile.

# Disclaimer
This is a test project to validate the feasibility of a fully private solution for question answering using LLMs and Vector embeddings. It is not production ready, and it is not meant to be used in production. The models selection is not optimized for performance, but for privacy; but it is possible to use different models and vectorstores to improve performance.
